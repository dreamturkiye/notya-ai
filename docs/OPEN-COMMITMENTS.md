# OPEN COMMITMENTS — Notya AI

**Why this file exists.** Work agreed in a session and deferred to "next time" was getting lost and
resurfacing weeks later as "why was this never done?". Chat history is not a tracking system.
Anything deferred goes here with a date and who it waits on, or it does not count as agreed.

## Waiting on the founder

| Since | Item | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-25 | **Configure custom SMTP in Supabase (Resend / Postmark / SendGrid)** — dashboard setting + DNS records | **LAUNCH BLOCKER for the doctor section.** Signup currently uses Supabase's built-in mail sender, which is development-grade and rate-limited; QA hit `email rate limit exceeded` after a handful of attempts. On launch day the first few doctors register, then every later signup silently fails to receive its confirmation link — no confirmation, no login, no trial. No custom SMTP is configured anywhere (`SMTP_*`, `RESEND_*`, `SENDGRID_*` all absent) and the app does not send its own mail. Needs account credentials and domain DNS, so it is a founder action |
| 2026-08-25 | **Complete the signup end-to-end test** once SMTP is live | The flow genuinely stops at the confirmation e-mail, so register → confirm → login → 15-day trial → dashboard cannot be verified until the mail path works |
| 2026-08-26 | **Decide the sender domain** (notya.ai vs alternative) | Undecided as of 2026-08-26. Does NOT need to block SMTP: Resend verifies any owned domain, and the Supabase sender is one config field — a subdomain of an already-owned domain unblocks the E2E today and the brand domain can be swapped in later |
| 2026-08-27 | **Submit the two Pabau partner applications** (Claude drafts, founder submits under the Notya brand) | (1) Referral Partner Program — up to 20% recurring revenue up to 3 years per referred clinic; (2) App Marketplace listing — distribution into Pabau's 3,000+ practices. Until approval, product and landing say only "Pabau ile çalışır" with a trademark note |
| 2026-08-27 | **Merge PR #19 (NOTYA-AUTH-01)** | Auth convention (session refresh, one 401); deploys to production on merge. /klinik landing (#25) merged and live 2026-08-30 |
| 2026-08-28 | **Pabau E2E with a real key** | The connect flow validates against live Pabau before storing (verified: bad key → 401 Invalid API Token) but end-to-end needs a real clinic API key — a Pabau trial account or a pilot clinic's key, pasted at /dashboard/klinik/pabau |
| 2026-08-28 | **Klinik uzman voice E2E** | /asistan/klinik rides the existing ElevenLabs base agents with prompt/voice overrides (the same mechanism /asistan uses in production). Needs one real mic session per gender to confirm overrides land |

## Operator work

| Since | Item | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-01 | **Restore a working typecheck** — DONE (PR #42) | Dropped `baseUrl` + `ignoreDeprecations` from tsconfig; `moduleResolution: bundler` with `paths` doesn't need `baseUrl` on TS 6, and dropping it removes the TS5101 abort. Re-run is clean, 0 errors — the 66 predicted here were fixed incidentally by PRs #38–#41 in the interim. `next.config.mjs` already has `ignoreBuildErrors: false` |
| 2026-08-25 | **Workflow verification (QA item 5)** | Not started: doctor workflows end-to-end — hasta ekle, belge yükleme, reçete, rapor, SGK |
| 2026-08-25 | **True 390px visual verification** | Chrome's resize_window moves the window but not the viewport, so mobile layout was proved from the code rather than seen. NOTYA-MOBILE-01 fixed the grids; a real device pass is still worth doing |
| 2026-08-25 | **Tailwind conversion for /doktor** | The page is built from ~102 inline style objects, which is why it could not hold a media query. The CSS-block fix is correct but the section is worth converting properly when the launch is not imminent |
| 2026-08-25 | **Only 8 media queries in the whole app** | /doktor is fixed. Other surfaces (mali, avukat, dashboard sub-pages) have not been audited for mobile |
| 2026-08-25 | **Auth guard convention fix** | The NOTYA-ILAC-04 session-key bug came from a route ignoring a pattern the app already had. One convention, applied to every doktor route, folded into whichever PR next touches them |
| 2026-08-26 | **`ruhsatAskida` not surfaced in the UI** — DONE (PR #42) | Flagged per-pack in the search dropdown, sunum select, and a warning banner in HastaIlaclar + shared IlacSecici. Brand badge only fires when every pack of the brand is suspended (6 brands are partial: CLIACIL, ILARIS, KARVEA DUO, MINOSET, RIVOTRIL, +1) |
| 2026-08-26 | **214 SGK barcodes with no TİTCK match** | 2.5% of records have no etken madde (no barcode match, no unambiguous eşdeğer grubu). Mostly allergen extracts and serums. Searchable by name; left blank rather than guessed. Re-check after the next TİTCK weekly list |
| 2026-08-26 | **TİTCK / SGK refresh cadence** | Both lists change weekly. `scripts/import-sgk-ilac.mjs` then `scripts/import-titck-etken.mjs` — no schedule exists yet. A stale list means a withdrawn drug still shows as reimbursed |
| 2026-08-26 | **tsconfig `baseUrl` deprecation (TS5101)** — DONE (PR #42) | `baseUrl` dropped, `paths` alone is enough under `moduleResolution: bundler` |
